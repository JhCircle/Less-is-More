## 🔍 Overview
This repository provides the full implementation of our Less is More framework, which distills high-quality structured reasoning data into multi-agent LLaMA-3 modules. It addresses low-resource structured reasoning by combining:

- 🧠 [Reverse-prompted](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.12323) task induction

- 🔍 [Retrieval-augmented](https://aclanthology.org/2023.tacl-1.75/) CoT generation

- 🏆 Reward-guided filtering for faithful and interpretable supervision
---

## 🚀 Highlights

- 🧩 **Modular Agents**: Specialized models for question parsing, CoT decomposition, and verification

- 🔍 **Semantic ICL Retrieval**: Top-k demos fetched via [BGE-M3](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/bge-m3) embeddings

- 🎯 **Reward Filtering**: [LLaMA3 reward](https://huggingface.co/Ray2333/GRM-Llama3.2-3B-rewardmodel-ft) model filters reasoning quality

- ⚡ **LoRA+ Fine-tuning**: Efficient SFT on each role using [ms-swift](https://github.com/modelscope/ms-swift)

- 📊 **Structured Output**: JSON-compatible format for downstream use

## 🛠️ How to Run

### 1️⃣ Step 1: 🧠 Data Synthesis
Generate high-quality Question Parsing (QP), Chain-of-Thought Parsing (CP), and CoT Verification (CV: including both statement extraction and logical validation) from raw [LogicQA](https://github.com/lgw863/LogiQA-dataset) questions using GPT-4o via Retrieval-Augmented In-Context Learninig.
```bash
python data_synthesize.py \
  --demo_pool demo_pool.json \
  --logiqa_file data/train.txt \
  --output_file data/Train_LogicQA.jsonl \
  --embedding_model BAAI/bge-m3 \
  --tokenizer_name BAAI/bge-m3 \
  --model_id gpt-4o-2024-08-06 \
  --api_key YOUR_API_KEY \
  --base_url YOUR_OPENAI_API
```

---

### 2️⃣ Step 2: 🏆 Reward Filtering
Use a reward model to evaluate CoT quality and retain only samples with **reward > 0**.

```bash
python reward_filter.py
```
#### 🎯 Strategy Options

| Strategy             | Description                                  |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `with_few_shot`      | Select samples with high reward under few-shot prompting (reward > 0) |
| `without_few_shot`   | Select samples with high reward under zero-shot prompting (reward > 0) |
| `average` _(default)_| Select samples with highest average reward across both settings (reward > 0) |

Generates:

- `data/All_Train_With_Scores.jsonl`
- `data/with_few_shot_filtered.jsonl`
- `data/without_few_shot_filtered.jsonl`
- `data/average_filtered.jsonl`

---

### 3️⃣ Step 3: 📊 Extract Role Data
Convert filtered CoT data into structured instruction formats for each role. Each file is used to train a different role agent (QP / CP / CV).
```bash
python scripts/extract_train_role.py
python scripts/extract_test_role.py
```

Outputs:

```bash
data/train/{strategy}/training_question_parsing_role.jsonl
data/train/{strategy}/training_cot_parsing_role.jsonl
data/train/{strategy}/training_cot_verify_role.jsonl
```

---

### 4️⃣ Step 4: 🧬 Fine-Tune Role Agents (QP / CP / CV)
Train each role agent (Question Parsing / CoT Parsing / CoT Verify) using reward-filtered data.
```bash
bash train_qp.sh
bash train_cv.sh
bash train_cs.sh
```

To switch filtering strategy (`with_few_shot`, `without_few_shot`, `average`, `all`), change this line in the `.sh` file:

```bash
strategy="average"
```
## ✅ Summary

| Role Agent   | Input File                                          | Task                        |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| QP (Parser)  | `training_question_parsing_role.jsonl`              | Extract constraints/facts  |
| CP (Parser)  | `training_cot_parsing_role.jsonl`                   | Break CoT into statements   |
| CV (Verifier)| `training_cot_verify_role.jsonl`                    | Find evidence + verify logic|

---

### 5️⃣ Step 5: Multi-Agent Structured Inference
Use the trained role agents to perform structured reasoning on new questions.

```bash
bash infer.sh

#!/bin/bash

TEST_FILE="test.jsonl"
QP_MODEL_PATH="./Question_Parsing"
CP_MODEL_PATH="./CoT_Parsing"
CV_MODEL_PATH="./CoT_Verify"
EMBEDDING_MODEL="BAAI/bge-m3"

python inference_pipeline.py \
  --test_file "$TEST_FILE" \
  --qp_model_id_or_path "$QP_MODEL_PATH" \
  --cp_model_id_or_path "$CP_MODEL_PATH" \
  --cv_model_id_or_path "$CV_MODEL_PATH" \
  --icl_embedding "$EMBEDDING_MODEL"

```

Produces `results.json` in the following structure:

            }
        ]
    }
